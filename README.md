Game design and analysis 



What is the title of my project 
- The title of my project is; BasketDrop



What is the idea of my project
- The idea of my project is to practice hand - eye coordination and reaction time 



What is the storyline of the project
 - The story is that basketballs are falling and if you don't catch enough the world will explode.



What are the different elements of the project
- There is a Golden ball which gives 5 points instead, there is the normal ball which gives you 1 point and there is the bombs which subtract points, there is also the basket which you catch the balls in 



Describe the behaviour of each element in detail/how does the object look like
- The balls are falling from the top of the screen and the basket has to collect them 



What are some NPC's and PC's elements: 
- the balls are NPC's and the basket is a PC 



What are the different states of the project: 
- The intro screen, The play screen, the game over screen



What are the elements of chance: 
- The element of chance is where the ball spawns, because the ball could spawn very close or very far from the player. making it easier or harder to catch the balls.



what are the elements of skill
- Since the balls are dropping fast you need to have a fast reaction time and be well coordinated to which requires skill.



How does the project provide balance between elements of chance and skill 
- Because no matter how low your score is you cant lose which allows lots of time to get used to it, The balls have a random spawn point meaning in theory the balls could spawn very close or very far from you making it easier or harder to score points. 



How does the game provide feedback to the players 
- It tells them their score(which relies on how many balls they catch or drop) and shows how many levels they have passed.

Is the game singleplayer or multiplayer: Single player
